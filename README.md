## Overview

The Urban Mobility Decision Support Tool is an online application built with Streamlit. This tool aims to facilitate the design and decision-making process for urban mobility systems by providing insights into the impact of different interventions. It allows users to compare indicators such as CO2 equivalent emissions, energy demand, and calories burned across various scenarios and personas.

## Features

- Explore different interventions and their impact on urban mobility systems.
- Compare indicators such as CO2 equivalent emissions, energy demand, and calories burned.
- Define and analyse across different scenarios.
- Incorporate personas to understand the varying needs and preferences of different user groups.
- Interactive visualisation of data and results.
- Easy-to-use interface with intuitive controls.
